1.when a break down occurs that will persist for many hours, we link truck drivers to road side assistance services near the area the break down has occured if need be. (we could also offer "loans" to truckers to cover road side assistance cost in the event that they don't have the cash to pay for the service there and then)
2.provide aproximate delivery time of cargo.
3.schedule group pick up using transit share or individual pick up date for up to 7 days in advance.
